<h2 id='s1'>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The SDMS is a federated data <i>collaboration</i> and <i>management</i> system for science. The SDMS provides many features that ease the <i>data management burden</i> associated with general scientific research; however, the primary goal of the SDMS is to <i>improve scientific data quality</i> by enabling precise full-life-cycle control over data artifacts, with the ability to uniformly share and access data across geographically distributed facilities. The combined capabilities of the SDMS directly support the concept of <i>"repeatable science"</i> by unambiguously identifying data, capturing context and metadata, and by providing the means to access and utilize data globally.

<p>The SDMS utilizes <a href="https://www.globus.org" target="_blank">Globus Online</a> for efficient and secure data transfers, as well as for user authentication. Globus Online can be thought of as a "data network" where data transfers take place between Globus "endpoints" - which are Globus services that enable access to underlying file systems hosted by member organizations. The SDMS adds a data management layer on top of Globus that permits data to be located and accessed without needing to know where the data is physically stored within the Globus network. Because the SDMS relies heavily on Globus, it is recommended that SDMS users familiarize themselves with how Globus works from the documentation <a href="https://www.globus.org/what-we-do" _target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id='s11'>1.1 Interfaces</h3>

<p>There are two ways to access the SDMS: 1) the SDMS Web Portal, and 2) the SDMS command-line interface (CLI). This on-line documentation primarily covers the SDMS Web Portal; however, the SDMS CLI is critical for accessing and managing data from within computational and analytics environments. The CLI was specifically created to ease the data management burden of computational scientists within HPC facilities with complex security environments.</p>
<p>The SDMS Web Portal provides full access to the SDMS through a graphical user interface. Whereas the SDMS CLI is intended primarily for accessing and updating data, the SDMS Web Portal is intended to facilitate tasks such as creating and organizing collections of data, sharing data with other users, managing projects, data browsing, and performing metadata queries.</p>

<h2 id='s2'>2. Registration</h2>

<p>User registration is required in order to access the SDMS. Registration is free and secure, but requires users to have, or obtain, a free <a href="https://www.globus.org" target="_blank">Globus Online</a> account. Many universities and research facilities, worldwide, are "member organizations" of Globus and typically provide Globus accounts for their students, staff, and/or users. If your home institute does not provide Globus accounts, you can obtain a personal Globus account through Globus ID, located <a href="https://www.globusid.org" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>SDMS registration utilizes a standard Globus authentication and authorization process. When you click the "register" button on the SDMS welcome page, you will be redirected to Globus for authentication (log-in) based on your Globus account. Globus will then ask you to authorize the SDMS to access your Globus identity and to allow the SDMS to transfer data on your behalf. Once this process is complete, you will be redirected to an SDMS post-registration page where you will create an SDMS password. This password is only used when manually authenticating from the SDMS command-line interface, and it can be updated from the SDMS Web Portal at any time.</p>

<p>Note that the SDMS will only initiate data transfers when you (or a process running as you) explicity request it to. Further, SDMS data transfers are constrained to be between SDMS data storage repositories and Globus endpoints that you have pre-authorized (or "activated") for access. Globus end-point activation is transient and access will expire within a period determined by the host institute.</p>

<h2 id='s3'>3. Storage Allocations</h2>

<p>Registering and gaining access to the SDMS does not, in itself, grant users the ability to create or manage data within the SDMS. This is due to the fact that the SDMS does not provide any data storage of its own, but instead relies on <i>federated</i> storage provided by SDMS member organizations. Federated storage is implemented through a network of geographically distributed "data repositories" that are owned and maintained by specific SDMS member organizations, yet potentially accessible by all SDMS users. It is the SDMS member organizations that individually determine how storage allocations are assigned to specific users.</p>

<p>Typically, SDMS users with an account at one or more SDMS member organizations will be automatically granted storage allocations on data repositories managed by those organizations. For unaffiliated users, storage allocations may be explicitly requested from an SDMS member organizations. SDMS member organizations are free to define and enact their own data storage policies; therefore, users wishing to acquire storage a specific allocation must contact the associated organization for information on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Even though unaffiliated users with no storage allocation cannot use the SDMS to create and manage their own data, the SDMS is still allows these users to locate, access, and monitor data owned by other SDMS users or projects.</p>

<h3 id='s31'>3.1 Multiple Allocations</h3>

<p>It is typical for SDMS users to have multiple storage allocations on different data repositories. In this case, a default storage allocation may be specified, or a specific storage allocation selected when creating new SDMS data records. Data can be accessed in a consistent manner no matter which data repository it is stored on; however, the physical location of a data repository in relation to the point of use of data can impact initial access time.</p>

<h2 id='s4'>4. Web Portal User Interface</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://sdms.ornl.gov" target="sdms_target">SDMS web portal</a> provides access to all SDMS functionality in the form of an graphical web application. The web portal provides easy-to-use features that make it the best tool for organizing, managing, and sharing collections of data; whereas the SDMS command-line-interface (CLI) is best used for directly accessing or updating raw data from within a compute or analytics environment.</p>

<p>The focal-point of the portal is a "Data Browser" that allows users to navigate through data, collections, and projects that they own or have access to. Depending on a users role and/or access permission, a variety of actions may be performed on the data, collections, and projects presented in the Data Browser (i.e. editing, sharing, etc.). Additional features include searching with metadata-based queries, viewing recent data transfers, and managing settings. Sections 4.1 through 4.6 describe the location and function(s) of the major elements of the web portal. Note that the web portal is implemented as a <i>single-page</i> application; therefore, web browser navigation functions (i.e. forward/back) should not be used.</p>
<h4>Browser Cookies</h4>
<p><i>Note tha the SDMS web portal uses browser cookies to store user identity and context information. Once these cookies are set, the SDMS web portal tracks a user's Globus Online authentication status and, while logged-in to Globus, users will be granted access to the SDMS portal without requiring an additional log-in. If a user wishes to disable web portal access, they must explicitly log-out of Globus using the "log-out" link <h href="https://www.globus.org/" target="_blank">here</h>.</i></p>

<h3 id='s41'>4.1 Data Browser</h3>
<p>The "Data Browser", located on the left hand side of the interface, contains a navigable tree structure organized into categories. When an item in the browser tree is selected (by either clicking on them, or using keyboard navigation), information about the item is displayed in the "Selection Information" panel located to the right of the browser panel.</p>
    <h4 id='s421'>4.2.1 My Data</h4>
        <p>This category of the Data Browser shows data records and collections owned by the current user. All valid actions are permitted on these data records and collections.</p>
    <h4 id='s422'>4.2.2 My Projects</h4>
        <p>This category of the Data Browser shows projects that are owned by the current user. All valid actions are permitted on these projects.</p>
    <h4 id='s423'>4.2.3 Managed Projects</h4>
        <p>This category of the Data Browser shows projects that are managed by the current user. Project managers are allowed to add/remove project members and set permissions on the root collection.</p>
    <h4 id='s424'>4.2.4 Member Projects</h4>
        <p>This category of the Data Browser shows projects that the current user is a member of. Project members are allowed to create and access data and collections per the permissions set by the project owner and/or manager.</p>
    <h4 id='s425'>4.2.5 Shared Data</h4>
    <h4 id='s426'>4.2.6 Search Results</h4>
<h3 id='s43'>4.3 Selection Information</h3>

<h3 id='s45'>4.5 Footer</h3>
    <p>The "footer" is the section of the user interface directly below the "action buttons" and contains a set of tabs for searching, view recent data transfers, and user settings. The footer can be collapsed and expanded by clicking the active tab.</p>
<h3 id='s451'>4.5.1 Search Tab</h3>
    <p>The "Search" tab on the Web Portal footer allows users to query the SDMS for data matching a specified metadata expression within a specified scope.</p>
<h3 id='s452'>4.5.2 Transfer Tab</h3>
    <p>The "Transfers" tab on the Web Portal footer shows recent data transfers (get/put) initiated either from the SDMS Web Portal or via the CLI.</p>
<h3 id='s453'>4.5.3 Settings Tab</h3>
    <p>The "Settings" tab on the Web Portal footer allows the current user to update a number of SDMS configuration parameters, as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>CLI Password</b> - This is the password that is required when manually authenticating through the SDMS CLI. This password is only required until the CLI "setup" command is used to generate and install local credentials.</li>
        <li><b>Revoke All Credentials</b> - This button will reset ALL installed CLI credentials. The CLI "setup" command must be used to generate and install new credentials per environment.</li>
        <li><b>User Interface Theme</b> - Allows the UI theme to set to "light" (default) or "dark".</li>
        <li><b>E-mail Address</b> - The E-mail address that will be used to contact the current user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These settings are saved automatically whenever they are changed.</p>
<h3 id='s41'>4.1 Header and Footer</h3>
    <p>The "header" is the section of the user interface at the very top of the page amd contains the title, a "help" button (which opens this document), and a "log-out" button. The "footer" is located at the very bottom of the page amd contains the status bar that displays the current user name and informational messages.</p>
