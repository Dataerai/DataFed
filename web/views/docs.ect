<h2 id='s1'>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The SDMS is a federated data <i>collaboration</i> and <i>management</i> system for science. The SDMS provides many features that ease the <i>data management burden</i> associated with general scientific research; however, the primary goal of the SDMS is to <i>improve scientific data quality</i> by enabling precise full-life-cycle control over data artifacts, with the ability to uniformly share and access data across geographically distributed facilities. The combined capabilities of the SDMS directly support the concept of <i>"repeatable science"</i> by unambiguously identifying data, capturing context and metadata, and by providing the means to access and utilize data globally.

<p>The SDMS utilizes <a href="https://www.globus.org" target="_blank">Globus Online</a> for efficient and secure data transfers, as well as for user authentication. Globus Online can be thought of as a "data network" where data transfers take place between Globus "endpoints" - which are Globus services that enable access to underlying file systems hosted by member organizations. The SDMS adds a data management layer on top of Globus that permits data to be located and accessed without needing to know where the data is physically stored within the Globus network. Because the SDMS relies heavily on Globus, it is recommended that SDMS users familiarize themselves with how Globus works from the documentation <a href="https://www.globus.org/what-we-do" _target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id='s11'>1.1 Interfaces</h3>

<p>There are two ways to access the SDMS: 1) the SDMS Web Portal, and 2) the SDMS command-line interface (CLI). This on-line documentation primarily covers the SDMS Web Portal; however, the SDMS CLI is critical for accessing and managing data from within computational and analytics environments. The CLI was specifically created to ease the data management burden of computational scientists within HPC facilities with complex security environments.</p>
<p>The SDMS Web Portal provides full access to the SDMS through a graphical user interface. Whereas the SDMS CLI is intended primarily for accessing and updating data, the SDMS Web Portal is intended to facilitate tasks such as creating and organizing collections of data, sharing data with other users, managing projects, data browsing, and performing metadata queries.</p>

<h3 id='s12'>1.2 System Concepts</h3>
<p>The SDMS aggregates and abstracts the federation of distributed data, storage systems, facilities, users, groups, and projects into a single logical unit - with a common nomenclature and uniform access patterns. Some of the components of the SDMS represent real physical systems; whereas others are purely abstract. These components are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Data Record</b> - A single unit of data with associated unique identity, attributes, metadata, and raw data.</li>
    <li><b>Collection</b> - An organizational unit with a unique identity and attributes that aggregates data records and/or subordinate collections.</li>
    <li><b>Root Collection</b> - A special collection associated with all users and projects that serves as a default parent container.</li>
    <li><b>User</b> - A person that is identified by a unique Globus account, with optionally linked facility accounts.</li>
    <li><b>Group</b> - A set of users with a unique identity and attributes used for project membership and access control purposes.</li>
    <li><b>Project</b> - An abstract unit with a unique identity and attributes composed of one or more member users and providing collective ownership of data.</li>
    <li><b>Access Control</b> - A set of inheritable permissions associated with a data record or collection that applies to specific users and/or groups, or, optionally, to users that are not explicitly specified.</li>
    <li><b>Facility</b> - A physical location that houses one or more data storage systems or compute resources that is federated into the SDMS network.</li>
    <li><b>Data Repository</b> - A logical unit with associated unique identity and attributes that represents a federated storage system located at a given facility.</li>
    <li><b>Storage Allocation</b> - A logical relationship between a user or project and a data repository specifying an allowed storage capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A key concept of the SDMS is that while users are presented as a single abstract system, data is physically distributed across member facilities and data repositories. From a logical viewpoint, users do not need to know where data is physically stored within the SDMS - data can be accessed from any supported facility by using assigned data record identifiers or user-defined aliases. From a performance standpoint, the physical storage location of data may matter - depending on where the data is being accessed from. For this reason, the SDMS will support data repository caching to optimize frequently accessed data. In addition, users with allocations on multiple data repositories may opt to migrate data between repositories based on usage locality.</p>

<h2 id='s2'>2. Registration</h2>

<p>User registration is required in order to access the SDMS. Registration is free and secure, but requires users to have, or obtain, a free <a href="https://www.globus.org" target="_blank">Globus Online</a> account. Many universities and research facilities, worldwide, are "member organizations" of Globus and typically provide Globus accounts for their students, staff, and/or users. If your home institute does not provide Globus accounts, you can obtain a personal Globus account through Globus ID, located <a href="https://www.globusid.org" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>SDMS registration utilizes a standard Globus authentication and authorization process. When you click the "register" button on the SDMS welcome page, you will be redirected to Globus for authentication (log-in) based on your Globus account. Globus will then ask you to authorize the SDMS to access your Globus identity and to allow the SDMS to transfer data on your behalf. Once this process is complete, you will be redirected to an SDMS post-registration page where you will create an SDMS password. This password is only used when manually authenticating from the SDMS command-line interface, and it can be updated from the SDMS Web Portal at any time.</p>

<p>Note that the SDMS will only initiate data transfers when you (or a process running as you) explicity request it to. Further, SDMS data transfers are constrained to be between SDMS data storage repositories and Globus endpoints that you have pre-authorized (or "activated") for access. Globus end-point activation is transient and access will expire within a period determined by the host institute.</p>

<h2 id='s3'>3. Storage Allocations</h2>

<p>Registering and gaining access to the SDMS does not, in itself, grant users the ability to create or manage data within the SDMS. This is due to the fact that the SDMS does not provide any data storage of its own, but instead relies on <i>federated</i> storage provided by SDMS member organizations. Federated storage is implemented through a network of geographically distributed "data repositories" that are owned and maintained by specific SDMS member organizations, yet potentially accessible by all SDMS users. It is the SDMS member organizations that individually determine how storage allocations are assigned to specific users.</p>

<p>Typically, SDMS users with an account at one or more SDMS member organizations will be automatically granted storage allocations on data repositories managed by those organizations. For unaffiliated users, storage allocations may be explicitly requested from an SDMS member organizations. SDMS member organizations are free to define and enact their own data storage policies; therefore, users wishing to acquire storage a specific allocation must contact the associated organization for information on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Even though unaffiliated users with no storage allocation cannot use the SDMS to create and manage their own data, the SDMS is still allows these users to locate, access, and monitor data owned by other SDMS users or projects.</p>

<h3 id='s31'>3.1 Multiple Allocations</h3>

<p>It is typical for SDMS users to have multiple storage allocations on different data repositories. In this case, a default storage allocation may be specified, or a specific storage allocation selected when creating new SDMS data records. Data can be accessed in a consistent manner no matter which data repository it is stored on; however, the physical location of a data repository in relation to the point of use of data can impact initial access time.</p>

<h2 id='s4'>4. Web Portal User Interface</h2>

<p>The focal-point of the <a href="https://sdms.ornl.gov" target="sdms_target">SDMS web portal</a> is the "Data Browser" that allows users to navigate through data, collections, and projects that they own or have access to. Depending on a users role and/or access permission, a variety of actions may be performed on the data, collections, and projects presented in the Data Browser (i.e. editing, sharing, etc.). Additional features include searching with metadata-based queries, viewing recent data transfers, and managing settings. Sections 4.1 through 4.6 describe the location and function(s) of the major elements of the web portal. Note that the web portal is implemented as a <i>single-page</i> application; therefore, web browser navigation functions (i.e. forward/back) should not be used.</p>

<p><i>Note that the SDMS web portal uses browser cookies to store user identity and context information. Once these cookies are set, the SDMS web portal tracks a user's Globus Online authentication status and, while logged-in to Globus, users will be granted access to the SDMS portal without requiring an additional log-in. If a user wishes to disable web portal access, they must explicitly log-out of Globus using the "log-out" link <h href="https://www.globus.org/" target="_blank">here</h>.</i></p>

<h3 id='s41'>4.1 Data Browser</h3>

<p>The "Data Browser", located on the left hand side of the interface, contains a navigable tree structure organized into categories. When an item in the browser tree is selected (by either clicking on them, or using keyboard navigation), information about the item is displayed in the "Selection Information" panel located to the right of the browser panel. In addition, the "action buttons" located below the data browser may be enabled or disabled depending on what actions are valid for the selected item.</p>

    <h4 id='s411'>4.1.1 Drag and Drop</h4>

    <p>Data records and collections in the browser tree may be organized by dragging items from one location to another. For example, data records in one collection may be dragged into another collection, or an entire collection may be dragged into another collection - whereupon the receiving collection becomes the parent of the moved data record or collection. By default, data records are linked into new locations when dragged, rather than moved. To move a data record, the "Shift" key must be held while dragging the data record. (Collections cannot be linked and are always moved.)</p>

    <p>A data record or collection can be "unlinked" from a parent collection by holding thr "Ctrl" key and clicking the data record. This does not delete the unlinked data record or collection, it simply removes it from the parent collection. In the case of collections, or data records that are not linked to other collections, unlinking will re-link the item to the root collection. This is because all data records and collections must have a parent collection (except for root collection itself).
