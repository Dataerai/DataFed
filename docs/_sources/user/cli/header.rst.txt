The DataFed command-line-interface (CLI) provides access to basic DataFed capabilities for both
interactive use and non-interactive scripting from a command shell, and is the primary means of
utilizing DataFed from within data, compute, and analytics environments. The DataFed
CLI is provided via a Python 3 package and can be used on any operating system where Python 3
is available.
