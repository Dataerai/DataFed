====================
Python API Reference
====================

The DataFed CLI can be used for scripting by using the "--script" option to produce output in JSON format;
however, Python API modules are also available for more complex scripting and/or custom application development.
There are two library modules, "CommandLib" and "MessageLib", that provide high- and-low-level application
programming interfaces (APIs), respectively, that can be used for Python scripting or custom application development.
The high-level API is almost identical to the the DataFed command-line interface, in that it accepts textual CLI
commands, but returns Python objects instead of text or JSON output. The low-level API, as the module name implies,
exposes the binary message-passing interface used by DataFed and is intended for more complex applications.

This is a placeholder for auto-generated DataFed API documentation.
