<h1>System Overview</h1>
<p>This document provides a high-level overview and description of the DataFed system and defines terminology and
key concepts that are prerequisites for subsequent DataFed documentation.</p>
<div class="section" id="architecture">
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The DataFed system is a network of distributed services and data storage repositories that enable users
to create, locate, share, and access living scientific data from any organization, facility, or workstation that
has access to Globus data services. DataFed provides a software framework for the federation of distributed
raw data storage resources along with centralized metadata indexing, data discovery, and collaboration
services that combine to form a virtual “data backplane” connecting otherwise disjoint systems into a
uniform data environment.</p>
<p>Unlike other data management systems that are installed and managed locally, DataFed has a single central
orchestration service that ties all of the independent DataFed repositories together into a single network.
This approach prevents data siloing yet is also scalable since data storage and transfer loading is distributed
across individual repositories.</p>
<p>While DataFed relies on Globus services (for user authentication and high-performance raw data movement via GridFTP),
DataFed presents managed data using a <em>logical</em> view (similar to a database) rather than a direct physical view
of files in directories on a particular file system. This is a critical aspect of simplifying access control and
reducing the confusion and thrash that can lead to data misidentification, mishandling, and an eventual loss of
reproducibility.</p>
<p>The figure below shows a simplified representation of an example DataFed network consisting of the central
DataFed services and several connected facilities. The enclosing gray boxes represent the physical boundaries
of geographically distributed, but networked, facilities. The wide blue arrows represent high-speed raw data
transfers between facilities, and the green arrows show DataFed client communication with DataFed services.</p>
<img alt="../_images/simplified_architecture.png" src="../_images/simplified_architecture.png" />
<p>In this example, there is an observational facility and a compute facility that each have a local DataFed
data repository (cylinder labeled with an ‘R’). Any facility in the system can read or write data from or to
the data repositories in the observational or compute facilities (assuming proper access permissions); however,
users within these two facilities will have lower latency access to the data stored in the local repositories.
In addition, independent workstations can also access data in these repositories - also assuming proper access
permissions are granted.</p>
<p>When data is stored to a DataFed repository, Globus is used to transfer a user-specified source file (as a Globus
path) into the repository where it becomes associated with a DataFed data record. Likewise, when data is retrieved
from a DataFed repository, Globus is used to transfer raw data of a DataFed record from the repository to a user-
specified Globus destination; however, note that the raw data is simply copied - not moved - from the DataFed
repository. The central DataFed service maintains data record tracking information and orchestrates raw data
transfers, but never directly handles raw data.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>DataFed provides a universal storage allocation and fine-grained access control mechanisms to
enable users at disjoint organizations to share and access data with each other without undue burden on
local system administrators. Local administrators are able to maintain and enforce data policies
on local DataFed repositories without disrupting remote DataFed facilities or users in any way.</p>
</div>
<p>Continuing with the example architecture, the experimental facility does not have a local DataFed repository
and, instead, could use allocations on the DataFed repository within the compute facility (if, for example, these
facilities were collaborating or were managed by the same organization). In this scenario, users at the experimental
facility would store and retrieve data using a DataFed allocation granted by the compute facility, but from the users
perspective, all DataFed interactions would look the same as if the repository were local. The only noticeable
difference would be increased latency associated with DataFed data transfers.</p>
<p>Many cross-facility and collaborative research scenarios are supported by DataFed, and specific examples are discussed
in the DataFed <a class="reference internal" href="usecases.html"><span class="doc">Use Cases</span></a> document.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interfaces">
<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<p>Users are able to interact with DataFed through several available interfaces including a graphical web application,
a command-line interface (CLI), and both high- and low-level application programming interfaces (APIs). The easiest
way to interact with DataFed is through the web application (see <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`/user/web/portal`_</span></a>), and the web application is
where users initially register for DataFed accounts.</p>
<p>The DataFed CLI and APIs are all provided through a single Python-based DataFed client packaged available on PyPi. For
information on installing the DataFed client, please refer to <a class="reference internal" href="../user/client/install.html"><span class="doc">Installation and Configuration</span></a>, and for the CLI and APIs, refer to
<a class="reference internal" href="../user/cli/guide.html"><span class="doc">User Guide</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../user/api/python.html"><span class="doc">Python API Reference</span></a>, respectively.</p>
<p>DataFed’s interfaces can be used from any workstation, laptop, or compute node; however, these interfaces only provide
users with the ability to issue commands to the DataFed central service. If users need to be able to also transfer raw
data to or from a given host machine, the local file system of the host machine must be connected to a Globus endpoint.
Typically, research facilities will already provide Globus endpoints to access specific local file systems; however, for
individual workstations and laptops, users will need to install Globus Personal Connect. See the <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">`/user/client/install`_</span></a>
for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="key-concepts">
<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<p>DataFed aggregates and abstracts the federation of distributed data, storage systems, facilities, users, groups,
and projects into a single logical unit - with a common nomenclature and uniform access patterns. Some of the
components of DataFed represent real physical systems; whereas others are purely abstract. These components are
defined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Data Record - A single unit of data with associated unique identity, attributes, metadata, and raw data.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection - An organizational unit with a unique identity and attributes that aggregates data records and/or subordinate collections.</p></li>
<li><p>Root Collection - A special collection associated with all users and projects that serves as a default parent container.</p></li>
<li><p>User - A person that is identified by a unique Globus account, with optionally linked facility accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Group - A set of users with a unique identity and attributes used for project membership and access control purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Project - An abstract unit with a unique identity and attributes composed of one or more member users and providing collective ownership of data.</p></li>
<li><p>Access Control - A set of inheritable permissions associated with a data record or collection that applies to specific users and/or groups, or, optionally, to users that are not explicitly specified.</p></li>
<li><p>Facility - A physical location that houses one or more data storage systems or compute resources that is federated into DataFed network.</p></li>
<li><p>Data Repository - A logical unit with associated unique identity and attributes that represents a federated storage system located at a given facility.</p></li>
<li><p>Storage Allocation - A logical relationship between a user or project and a data repository specifying an allowed storage capacity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A key idea of DataFed is the presentation of data in an location-agnostic manner. From a logical viewpoint,
users do not need to know where data is physically stored within DataFed - data can be accessed from any supported
facility, or the web portal, by using assigned data record identifiers or user-defined aliases. From a performance
standpoint, the physical storage location of data likely matters depending on where the data is being accessed from.
For this reason, DataFed will support data repository caching to optimize frequently accessed data. In addition, users
with allocations on multiple data repositories may opt to migrate data between repositories based on usage locality.</p>
<div class="section" id="identifiers-and-aliases">
<h3>Identifiers and Aliases</h3>
<p>All records in DataFed (data, collections, user, projects, etc.) are automatically assigned a system-unique identifier
consisting of a prefix and an alphanumeric value. For data records and collections these identifiers are numeric, so
users may choose to assign a more human-friendly “alias” that can be used in place of identifiers. Aliases are alphanumeric
(with certain restrictions) and case sensitive, and, to avoid collisions, are automatically prefixed with the type (“u” or
“p”) and value portion of the identifier of the owning user or project, delimited with colons. When aliases are used by the
owner, the alias prefix may be omitted.</p>
<p>For example, if a user with an ID of “u/jsmith” creates an alias “mydata”, then the full alias would be “u:jsmith:mydata”.
User “jsmith” can simply use “mydata”, but other users would need to use the full alias instead. Note that in DataFed web
portal, aliases are typically shown without the prefix.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collective-ownership">
<h3>Collective Ownership</h3>
<p>When an individual user creates a data record or collection, that user becomes the owner and is granted full control of
the newly created data record or collection. Collective ownership is achieved through the use of <em>projects</em>. A DataFed
project is a distinct organizational entity that permits multiple associated users to create and manage data records and
collections as a team - without requiring member users to configure individual access control rules. When a project member
creates a data record or collection, the project becomes the owner of the new record, rather than the creating user;
however, both the project (project owner and administrators) as well as the creating user have administrative rights to the
created record. Other project members have access to project data based on project-wide access control lists managed by the
project owner and administrators.</p>
<p>Projects support specific roles for associated users:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Project Owner - These users have complete control over the project and contained data and collections. The user that
initially creates a project becomes an administrator by default, but a project can have multiple administrators assigned.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrators - These users have the ability to add and remove project members (but not administrators or other
managers), and can also configure access control rules on the projects root collection. A project can have multiple
managers assigned by administrators.</p></li>
<li><p>Members - These users may create and update data records and collections based on the access control rules set by
managers or administrators. Always has administrative access to created records.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metadata">
<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>Data records support user-defined metadata. “Metadata” is distinct from built-on record attributes such as title and description,
and is represented using Javascript Object Notation (JSON). JSON was selected because it is human-readable and can represent
arbitrary structured documents. When creating or updating a data record, metadata may be directly specified in textual form, or,
with DataFed CLI, a JSON file may be used as the metadata source. When updating, the user has the option to either replace existing
metadata or to merge new metadata with existing metadata. In the case of merging, any keys that are present both the new and
existing metadata will be overwritten by the new values - other existing keys are left unchanged and new keys are inserted.</p>
<p>Note that when providing metadata, it must fully comply with the JSON specification, located at <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collection-hierarchies">
<h2>Collection Hierarchies</h2>
<p>Collection hierarchies within DataFed may resemble a file system with directories containing files and sub-directories.
While similar structurally, there are profound functional differences between DataFed collection hierarchies and typical
file systems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In a file system, a file cannot be accessed without <em>traversing</em> the directory structure in which it is contained
(the file’s path). The path of the file determines who can access the file through permissions set on
the individual directories of the path and the file itself. In DataFed, a data record or collection can be accessed
directly by its unique identifier or alias, and permissions are either inherited from the containing hierarchy, set
directly on the data record, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>In a file system, a file typically resides in a single directory. Some file systems support linking, which allows file
contents to be shared by multiple file instances, but the linked files may have different filenames. DataFed allows
data records (but not collections) to be contained in multiple collection hierarchies. This is achieved by a mechanism
similar to linking in a file system; except that there is always only one instance of the data record.</p></li>
<li><p>In a file system, there is no way to consistently and unambiguously identify a specific file instance over time. Because
a file’s identity is defined only by it path, if the file is moved, it essentially has a new identity. On the other hand,
a file could be overwritten by a new file with the same path but entirely different contents - in this case the new file
has the identity of a previous file, but may be entirely unrelated. DataFed associates a unique, immutable, and non-
recyclable identifier with data records and collections. No matter which collections it is placed in, or how many times
it is update, or where the associated raw data is physically stored, a record’s identity is always the same.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-control">
<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>DataFed implements fine-grained access control through a set of permissions that can be applied to both data records and
collections. Permissions can be configured to apply to anyone, specific users, groups of users, or a combination of any of
these. Data records and collections share the same set of permissions; however, collections have an additional set of
permissions specifically for permission inheritance. The individual permissions are defined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>VIEW - Allows users to list a data record or collection and view basic information.</p></li>
<li><p>READ_META - Allows users to read any metadata associated with a data record.</p></li>
<li><p>READ_DATA - Allows users to read raw data associated with a data record, or to list the contents of a collection.</p></li>
<li><p>WRITE_META - Allows users to create or update metadata associated with a data record.</p></li>
<li><p>WRITE_DATA - Allows users to create or update raw data associated with a data record, or to add or remove items within a collection.</p></li>
<li><p>ADMIN - Allows users to edit basic information, set access controls, move, and/or delete a data record or collection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above permissions may be combined and applied to a data record or collection using one of the following permission scopes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>User - Permission apply to a specified user.</p></li>
<li><p>Group - Permission apply to a specific group.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple user- and group- scoped permission may be applied. Permissions for a given user are evaluated by combining all
permission set for all scopes that apply - including permissions that may be inherited from parent collection hierarchies.
Because permissions are inherited and additive, the absence of a permission on a given data record or collection is not
equivalent to denying that permission.</p>
<p>Access controls are typically applied to parent collections of a collection hierarchy where contained data and sub-collections
inherit the permissions defined by the top-level parent. Collections have both “local” and “inherited” permissions; where
local permissions control access to the collection record itself, and “inherited” permissions are the permissions passed
down to all contained data records and sub-collections. Note that because data records can be placed into multiple collections,
the inherited permissions of <em>all</em> associated parent collections are evaluated for each users accessing a given data record.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-allocations">
<h2>Storage Allocations</h2>
<p>Having access to DataFed does not, in itself, grant users the ability to create or manage data within DataFed. This is because
DataFed does not provide any raw data storage of its own, but instead relies on <em>federated</em> storage provided by DataFed member
organizations. Federated storage is implemented through a network of geographically distributed “data repositories” that are
owned and maintained by specific DataFed member organizations, yet potentially accessible by all DataFed users. It is DataFed
member organizations that individually determine how storage allocations are assigned to specific users.</p>
<p>Typically, DataFed users with an account at one or more DataFed member organizations will be automatically granted storage
allocations on data repositories managed by those organizations. For unaffiliated users, storage allocations may be explicitly
requested from a DataFed member organizations. DataFed member organizations are free to define and enact their own data storage
policies; therefore, users wishing to acquire storage a specific allocation must contact the associated organization for
information on how to proceed. Even though unaffiliated users with no storage allocation cannot use DataFed to create and manage
their own data, DataFed is still allows these users to locate, access, and monitor data owned by other DataFed users or projects.</p>
<p>It is typical for DataFed users to have multiple storage allocations on different data repositories. In this case, a default
storage allocation may be specified, or a specific storage allocation selected when creating new DataFed data records. Data can
be accessed in a consistent manner no matter which data repository it is stored on; however, the physical location of a data
repository in relation to the point of use of data can impact initial access time.</p>
<p>User registration is required in order to access DataFed. Registration is free and secure, but requires users to have, or obtain,
a free <a class="reference external" href="https://www.globus.org">Globus</a> account. Many universities and research facilities, worldwide, are “member organizations”
of Globus and typically provide Globus accounts for their students, staff, and/or users. If your home institute does not provide
Globus accounts, you can obtain a personal Globus account through Globus ID, located <a class="reference external" href="https://www.globusid.org">here</a>.</p>
<p>DataFed registration utilizes a standard Globus authentication and authorization process. When you click the “register” button on
DataFed welcome page, you will be redirected to Globus for authentication (log-in) based on your Globus account. Globus will then
ask you to authorize DataFed to access your Globus identity and to allow DataFed to transfer data on your behalf. Once this process
is complete, you will be redirected to a DataFed post-registration page where you will create a DataFed password. This password is
only used when manually authenticating from DataFed command-line interface, and it can be updated from DataFed Web Portal at any
time.</p>
<p>Note that DataFed will only initiate data transfers when you (or a process running as you) explicitly request it to. Further,
DataFed data transfers are constrained to be between DataFed data storage repositories and Globus endpoints that you have pre-authorized
(or “activated”) for access. Globus end-point activation is transient and access will expire within a period determined by the host
institute.</p>
