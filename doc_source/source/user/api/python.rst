====================
Python API Reference
====================

There are two library modules, ``CommandLib`` and ``MessageLib``, that provide high- and-low-level application
programming interfaces (APIs), respectively, that can be used for Python scripting or custom application development.

The high-level API is almost identical to the the DataFed command-line interface (CLI), in that it accepts textual CLI
commands, but returns Python objects instead of text or JSON output.

The low-level API, as the module name implies,
exposes the binary message-passing interface used by DataFed and is intended for more complex applications.
