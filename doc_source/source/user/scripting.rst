DataFed offers multiple ways in which a user can interact with DataFed or script data orchestration using DataFed:

1. `Command Line Interface (CLI) <./cli/reference.html>`_

   a. Interactive
   b. Scripting
2. `Python interface <../autoapi/datafed/CommandLib/index.html>`_

Each approach caters to a different audience and sets of use-cases.
Readers are encouraged to use the CLI for quick and interactive needs that are not automated.
We encourage the use of the python interface for automation and robust data orchestration needs.
