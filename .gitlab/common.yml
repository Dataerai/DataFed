# Prevents downstream pipeline from being empty and triggering a failure, the
# build-ws job above may or may not run because of the rules section, if there
# are no jobs in the pipeline GitLab has the unfortunate behavior of reporting
# the trigger as a failure. To prevent the pipeline from being empty the
# placeholder job is created. 
# 
# There are open proposals addressing this issue that have not yet been finished.
# Possibly in the future a "stragetgy: mirror" option could be used to mimic the
# status of the downstream pipeline in the trigger job. See discussion here:
